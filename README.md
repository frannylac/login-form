## Modifications and use
This is a GPL V3 project, no comercial use is intented. Feel free to learn from this project and run it every time you want.

## How to run it?
I usually use a node module called **simplehttpserver** for this (web only).

#### Install
`npm i simplehttpserver`

#### Use
Move to the project directory at your terminal and type `simplehttpserver -p PORT` (Port 80 needs sudo permissions).

Then go to browser at `http://localhost:PORT` and pick up your HTML file (index.html is automatically loaded).

## Live reload (web & Visual Studio code only)
I usually use an extension called **LiveReload** developed by **ziishaned**. it's a little old but do the job.

### Note
Every **index.html** has a script tag which automatically loads LiveReload's script, you just need to enable the server from VSC (Visual Studio Code).

#### Download

https://github.com/ziishaned/livereload-vscode

#### How to enable it?
From Visual Studio Code press `Ctrl+Shift+P`, write `livereload` and select **LiveReload: Enable/Disable server**.
